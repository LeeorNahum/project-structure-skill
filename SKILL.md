description: Choose and normalize opinionated project/repo structure. Use when starting, reorganizing, splitting, or auditing a project; deciding between planning repo, full project root, web/app monorepo, firmware/library repo, artifact snapshot, or event deliverable; or creating the minimum durable files for the chosen shape.

# Project Structure

Classify the project before creating structure. The right folder shape should make the work easier to inhabit, not just look organized.

Prefer the smallest durable shape that can ship the project. Do not create planning folders, `.gitkeep` placeholders, research directories, or task files just because a project is new.

## Verdict First

Start with a short verdict:

```text
Recommended shape: <shape>
Why: <one sentence>
First files: <files>
First three tasks: <tasks>
```

Then give the folder shape and any caveats.

## Shapes

### Minimal Artifact Or Package Repo

Use for a single releaseable artifact such as a theme, preset, config package, template, small asset pack, downloadable zip, or other repo where the artifact is the product.

```text
project-name/
├── AGENTS.md
├── README.md
├── PROJECT.md
├── <artifact-folder>/
└── <minimal build/package script if needed>
```

Only add folders that hold real files now. Skip `TASKS.md`, `docs/`, `research/`, `decisions/`, `resources/`, and `.gitkeep` files unless the user asked for them or the artifact already needs them.

If unsure whether a project is a planning repo or a minimal artifact repo, ask before creating structure. Default to minimal when the immediate goal is "make/publish/install this thing."

### Small Planning Repo

Use for tiny, early, or spec-only projects.

```text
Project-Plan/
├── AGENTS.md
├── PROJECT.md
└── TASKS.md
```

Graduate when decisions, research, meetings, code, hardware, or media no longer fit cleanly in root files.

### Planning Repo

Use when the project is still being designed but already has product/software/hardware/research decisions.

```text
Project-Plan/
├── AGENTS.md
├── PROJECT.md
├── TASKS.md
├── docs/
│   ├── product/
│   ├── software/
│   ├── hardware/
│   ├── research/
│   └── decisions/
└── meetings/
```

`PROJECT.md` owns strategy and scope. `TASKS.md` owns executable state. Stable decisions move into `docs/decisions/`.

### Full Project Root

Use when a project spans multiple serious surfaces such as planning, web/app, firmware, hardware, devices, assets, presentation, research, or public packaging. This is not hardware-only; hardware projects are just the clearest example.

```text
Project Name/
├── AGENTS.md
├── Planning/
├── Firmware/
├── Web/
├── Devices/
├── Assets/
├── Presentation/
└── Research/
```

Only create folders that correspond to real surfaces. Keep planning, code, devices, media, and presentation artifacts separate. Give serious subprojects their own `AGENTS.md`.

### Web/App Monorepo

Use for deployable TypeScript web, app, extension, or service surfaces.

```text
project-slug/
├── AGENTS.md
├── apps/
├── packages/
├── docs/
└── package.json
```

Add `TASKS.md` only when the repo needs durable executable state. Do not require it for small web apps or extensions by default.

### Firmware Or Library Repo

Use for PlatformIO firmware, reusable C++ libraries, BLE/OTA/sensor packages, or hardware abstraction code.

```text
firmware-library/
├── AGENTS.md
├── README.md
├── platformio.ini
├── include/
├── src/
├── lib/
├── hardware/
├── examples/
├── test/
└── docs/
```

Add `TASKS.md` only when the repo needs durable executable state.

### Artifact Snapshot

Use for posters, slides, screenshots, CAD exports, 3D prints, media packets, and event deliverables.

```text
Artifact Name YYYY-MM-DD/
├── README.md
├── source/
├── exports/
├── references/
├── screenshots/
├── photos/
└── notes.md
```

Record source files, final export format, public-safe caption/description, and missing media or privacy constraints.

## Naming

- Local project roots can be human-readable: `Project Name`.
- Code repos should use deployable/package slugs: `project-website`, `project-firmware`, `project-skill`.
- Planning repos use `Project-Plan`.
- Keep old date-stamped folders as snapshots unless current work revives them.

## First Files

Every non-trivial project starts with the minimum files that fit its shape.

- `AGENTS.md`: durable agent operating rules for any serious repo
- `PROJECT.md`: canonical purpose, scope, users, and non-goals for planning repos or larger project roots
- `TASKS.md`: executable state for planning repos or larger active projects, not mandatory for every code repo

Do not duplicate facts across files. Update the owning file and link to it.

For minimal artifact repos, keep `PROJECT.md` very short or omit it when `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` already cover the durable facts.

## First Three Tasks

1. Define one core outcome and one non-goal.
2. Write the smallest useful end-to-end deliverable.
3. Identify manual blockers: credentials, hardware, account owner, photos, domains, API keys.

## Boundaries

- Do not put project history or diary text into `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not use a full project root for a tiny idea unless it has multiple real surfaces.
- Do not collapse related-but-distinct products into one repo just because they share parts.
- Keep shape decisions separate from domain implementation details.
- If a project only needs one subfolder shape, use that shape directly instead of forcing a full product root.
- Do not over-apply this skill by scaffolding future folders. Structure should prove it is needed by holding real project content.
